# Mushroom-ML-Classification
CRISP-DM style project involving Decision Tree, Naive Bayesian and Rule Induction classification algorithms to reverse-engineer the set of rules used to generate a set of data.

The dataset was obtain from kaggle and was generated from a set of rules. Our overt goal was to analyse the data, but an implicit goal was for us to reverse-engineer those rules using machine learning methods.
